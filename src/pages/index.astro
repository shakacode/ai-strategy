  <h1>AI Strategy at ShakaCode</h1>

  <p>
    We believe AI-assisted development is the most significant shift in software
    engineering since open source. This site documents how we're navigating it:
    our governance model, what we've learned from the industry, and the
    open-source tooling we've built along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything here is open source. If you disagree with something, think we're
    missing something, or have a better approach —

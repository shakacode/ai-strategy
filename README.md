How ShakaCode approaches AI-assisted development: our governance model, industry research, and open-source tooling.

Our AI development toolkit is a separate repo: [shakacode/claude-code-commands-skills-agents](https://github.com/shakacode/claude-code-commands-skills-agents). It includes the slash commands, agents, templates, and GitHub Actions that implement the philosophy described here.

## Contributing

This is an open-source repo. If you disagree with something, think we're missing something, or want to share how your team handles AI governance — open a PR or start a discussion.

We're especially interested in:
- How other teams are implementing governance frameworks
- Research we should be citing
- Practical tooling and workflow improvements
- Corrections or clarifications
